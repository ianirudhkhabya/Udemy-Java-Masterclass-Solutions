Write a method called checkNumber with an int parameter number.

The method should not return any value, and it needs to print out:

"positive" if the parameter number is > 0

"negative" if the parameter number is < 0

"zero" if the parameter number is equal to 0



NOTE: The checkNumber method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to your solution code!
